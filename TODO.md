# TODO

- Review https://mysticatea.github.io/eslint-plugin-es and decide if certain
  es6 featues should be banned outright in the "core" or "fantasy" configs

# MAYBE

- Consider adding an `--prettier:false` option flag to allow opting out of
  prettier. (Easy to do but needs more thought/discussion - perhaps only if
  the need ever arises.)
